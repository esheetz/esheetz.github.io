      I have participated in a number of research projects throughout my
      undergraduate career, including two Research Experiences for
      Undergraduates (REUs).  For more details on my responsibilities during
      these research projects, see my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>.  My
      primary research interests include autonomous systems and artificial
      intelligence.

          During the summer of 2014, I participated in the Summer Opportunities for
          Intellectual Activity (SO<i>f</i>IA) project, a three week research
          experience through Monmouth College focused on introducing freshmen to
          research.  I worked on the High Speed Imagery and Mathematical Modelling
          project, in which we

            a soap bubble</a>.

        <p>
          During the 2014 - 2015 school year, I conducted independent research in
          the high speed imagery lab under the supervision of Dr. Michael
          Sostarecz.  I used
          <a href="PIV.pdf" target="_tab">particle image velocimetery (PIV)</a>
           to explore water flow around an airfoil at various angles of attack.

          The culmination of the Monmouth College Honors Program is an
          interdisciplinary capstone project.  With the help of supervisors Dr.
          Michael Sostarecz and Dr. Hannah Schell, I researched and integrated
          topics in the mathematics of chaos theory and philosophical questions
          of free will.  My capstone project involved an

      <h3>CAT Vehicle REU</h3>
      <p>
        I spent the summer of 2016 at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona
        working with the Cognitive Autonomous Test (CAT) Vehicle REU.  My
        research partner and I used system identification methods to create a
        mathematical model to represent the internal dynamics of the CAT
        Vehicle's controller.  By the end of the ten week program, we had found
        a model for the velocity controller in the vehicle and demonstrated our
        model on a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller.  Our
        research is explained in our
        <a href="CATVehicle_paper.pdf" target="_tab">paper draft</a>.
        As part of the program, my fellow REU participants and I put together
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgv6eqdxbew&list=PLcXdwRQiNMIo2rxe9W9NUn9WRYwAn8YQ2&index=1"

      <h3>REU on Smart UAVs</h3>
      <p>
        I spent the summer of 2017 at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama
        working at the REU for Smart Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  My
        research partner and I took a unique approach to the problem of visual
        homing by combining techniques from previous works.  The route of the
        UAV's exploratory journey away from home was represented by snapshots,
        turning the problem of long-range visual homing into visiting a series
        of local waypoints.  We trained a convolutional neural network to
        estimate the homography between reference snapshots and camera images
        of the return journey.  Using the homography, we could compute the
        direction vector for the UAV to navigate home.  Our research is
        explained in our
        <a href="#" target="_tab">paper draft</a>
        and our
        <a href="" target="_tab">final presentation</a>.

          <p>
            This paper explains some of the flaws of navigation relying on
            GPS signals.  The problems of GPS motivate research in visual homing.

        <li><a href="/SmartUAVs_related/computervision">Computer Vision Tools</a></li>
        <p>
          This paper is the result of the work done by participants of the 2016
          REU on Smart UAVs, and explains how computer vision tools, such as
          <i>OpenCV</i>, can be used with simulation tools, such as <i>OpenGL</i>.
          While we did not use <i>OpenGL</i> for our simulations, this paper
          helped us fully consider the effectiveness of the tools available
          to us.
