      <h1>Teaching Experience</h1>

      <p>
        I greatly value education, and will make education, leadership, and mentorship a part of my career.
        I believe we need to provide support and mentorship for underrepresented students,
        inspire exploration of excitement about STEM fields and research,
        and encourage students to make the most of their education and unique opportunities.
        As an undergraduate and graduate student, I have worked as a tutor, teaching assistant, and research mentor.
        <!--

        <h3>Lumiere Education Research Mentor</h3>
        <h4>Virtual, June 2021 - Present</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.lumiere-education.com/">Lumiere Education</a>
          is a program that introduces high school students around the world by pairing them with
          a graduate student research mentor in their area of interest.
          As a research mentor, I guide students through the academic research process,
          teach them foundational material in various areas of computer science,
          and support them as they produce an undergraduate-level research paper.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have mentored students through 12-week research projects in the following areas:
          <ul>
            <li>Autonomous Vehicles and Methods to Achieve Complete Automation in Automobiles</li>
            <li>Blockchain Based Messaging System for Increased User Privacy</li>
            <li>Using Neural Networks to Predict Football Match Results</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          I have mentored students through 6-month research projects that allow them to dive deeper into their area of interest.
          I have mentored students on the following projects:
          <ul>
            <li>Comparing SLAM Implementations Using Different Sensor Models</li>
            <li>Using Neural Networks to Predict Energy Absorption of a Wave Energy Device</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          I also mentor for Lumiere's newly developed <a href="https://www.veritasai.com/">Veritas AI</a> program,
          which introduces high school students to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) oncepts.
          My role is to assist with lectures and code walk-throughs that illustrate these concepts,
          and lead small groups of students to apply AI and ML algorithms on their own in Python.
          Our students have a range of programming and computer science experience,
          making this an exciting opportunity to teach diverse high school students about
          the applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

          In my teaching, I encourage students to focus on problem-solving techniques
          and approach problems in different ways
          depending on how they reason about concepts.
